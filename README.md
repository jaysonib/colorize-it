# colorize-it

Image colorization is a challenging task and a topic of ongoing research in the area of Computer Vision. 
We present a convolutional-neural-network-based system that faithfully colorizes black and white photographic images without direct human assistance. 
We explore various network architectures, objectives, color spaces, and problem formulations. 
The final classification-based model we build generates colorized images that are significantly more aesthetically-pleasing than those created by the baseline regression-based model, demonstrating the viability of our methodology and revealing promising avenues for future work.
